# Some good practices in component testing (using React Testing Library)

## Testing approach

- Use React Testing Library, it's awesome!
- Use `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` for the most semantic and accessible selectors in your tests
- Use `screen.getByRole` or `screen.getByText` primarily for querying elements
- Use `data-testid` for querying elements only if getByRole or getByText is not sufficient (e.g. dynamic language changes the label of elements)
- Don't use `id`s or `className` to find elements
- Understand the difference between **getBy** (sync), **findBy** (async) and **queryBy** (conditional) element queries
- Test if component renders with required props
- Test if component renders with custom props
- Test component listening to callbacks from child
- Mock what you can
- Use easily readable string values in props and assertions instead of object dictionaries
- Stick to testing boundaries
- UI components should have an optional `testID` prop, which renders a `data-testid` with the appropriate value on the component's wrapper element
- Components nested within other components are passed the `testID`, so they can generate their own internal `testID`s (e.g.: 'hero' ⇒ 'hero-image')
- Minimise the reliance on `data-testid`, (but component should support `data-testid`, so QA testers can use them with e2e tests such as [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/))
- Test component states (open modal, close modal)
- Test with component states with keyboard navigation (TAB, ENTER, ESC)
- Use `userEvent`, don't use `fireEvent` to fire user events
- [Avoid common mistakes](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library#having-multiple-assertions-in-a-single-waitfor-callback) with React Testing Library

## Testing recipes

### Recipe #1 - Use `getByRole` and `within`

![A Status banner component used to let users know when their requested action was executed successfully](@assets/img/posts/front-end/testing-with-react-testing-library-01.webp)

```js
const letterStatusBannerRegion: HTMLElement = screen.getByRole('region', {
  name: /document request sent via letter/i,
});

expect(letterStatusBannerRegion).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(within(letterStatusBannerRegion).getByText(/by your\.name@email\.com \./i)).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(within(letterStatusBannerRegion).getByText(/at 10:18 on 31 jan 2023./i)).toBeInTheDocument();
```

### Recipe #2 - Testing state in hooks

Interestingly I've found that testing state in hooks doesn't work when using destructuring assignment, because the destructuring assignment returns a "snapshot" of values from the `result.current` object, and will not update when a state update happens.

```js
import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react'

describe('useCommunication()', () => {
  it('sets the channel', async () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() =>
      useCommunication({
        channel: 'email',
      }),
    )

    // This will pass
    expect(result.current.channel).toBe('email')
    act(() => {
      result.current.setChannel('letter')
    })
    expect(result.current.channel).toBe('letter')

    // This will fail
    /* 
		const { channel, setChannel } = result.current;
    expect(channel).toBe('email');
    act(() => {
      setChannel('letter');
    });
    expect(channel).toBe('letter');
		*/
  })
})
```

### Recipe #3 - Find an element by role and matching aria description

```html
<p id="message-hint">For example, "Hello world".</p>
<textarea name="message" label="Message" aria-describedby="message-hint" />
```

DOM of text area described by a paragraph of text

```js
expect(
  screen.getByRole('textbox', {
    description: /for example, "hello world"\./i,
  }),
).toBeVisible()
```
