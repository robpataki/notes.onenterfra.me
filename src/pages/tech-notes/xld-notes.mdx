# XLD file naming guide

[**XLD**](https://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html) is a super cool open source audio converter. Unfortunately the documentation is quite spotty around file naming and meta data so I created my own guide for XLD file naming.

## Compilations

```sh
%A - %T  -  %n - %a - %t
```

**Examples:**

- Various Artists - Underground Sound of Miami Series 1&nbsp; -&nbsp;06 - Maher Daniel & Casa (aka Mike Casa) - Music, Machines & Life.m4a
- Various Artists - Soul: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&nbsp; -&nbsp;02 - Born to Play Reprise.m4a
- Various Artists - Judgement Night OST&nbsp; -&nbsp;04 - Biohazard & Onyx - Judgment Night.m4a

## Albums by the same artist

```sh
%A - %T  -  %n - %t
```

**Examples:**

- Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral&nbsp; -&nbsp; 04 - March of the Pigs.m4a
- Nujabes - Metaphorical Music&nbsp; -&nbsp; 09 - A Day by Atmosphere Supreme.m4a
- G-Pal - Life&nbsp; -&nbsp; 03 - Aegan Sea.m4a
