# Git LFS notes

[**Git LFS**](https://git-lfs.com/) (Large File Storage) is a great tool that stores binary files as pointers instead of actual files to save on storage and bandwith in your Git repos.

When you stage and commit a file with **Git LFS** installed and marked for tracking, **Git LFS** picks up the file and starts tracking it. When **Git LFS** is not installed obviously **Git** will do the tracking automatically. The problem arises when these 2 titans clash and that is a painful thing to deal with. This can happen simply by one person not installing Git LFS on their local environment and the üí©üå™Ô∏è happens.

I feel there is one golden rule every team should follow the moment they decide to use **Git LFS** : Devs must have Git LFS installed as soon as they get access to the repo. Based on my experience on large projects (monorepo with 4-5 teams and 30+ devs) it is enough for one person to accidentally track a file with **Git** which would normally be tracked by **LFS** and the whole team will suffer until someone sorts the mess out.

| If you're looking for some useful **git** commands for everyday dev work [check out my Git notes](/tech-notes/git-notes).

If you're here I assume you're dealing with some Git LFS pain and I hope my notes will help you.

## Basic Git LFS commands (normal operation, no drama)

Use these commands for standard operation with Git LFS.

### Install Gif LFS and pull the remote LFS pointers

```sh
git lfs install && git lfs pull
```

### Remove Git LFS and reset local branch

I find these 2 commands super useful when **Git LFS** finds untracked files that need removing from **Git**:

```sh
git lfs uninstall && git reset --hard HEAD
```

### List tracked files

```sh
git lfs ls-files
```

### List deleted files

```sh
git lfs ls-files --deleted
```

## Git LFS - Move already tracked files from _git_ to _LFS_ (such drama)

When **Git** ends up tracking a file that usually would be tracked by **Git LGS** devs will see files popping up out of nowhere, and they will soon find other strange things happening, such as:

- Random files appear out of nowhere and `git reset --hard HEAD` doesn't remove them
- **Git LFS** starts nagging about the untracked files
- No **Git LFS** command (uninstall, pull, migrate, import) helps

What a pain... But worry not just follow these steps:

### 1. Remove the file from Git

```sh
  git rm --cached my-file.png
```

### 2. Track file (let LFS catch it)

```sh
  git add my-file.png
```

### 3. Commit the changes

```sh
  git commit -m "Add file to LFS"
```

### 4. Verify my-file is bein tracked as a pointer by Git LFS

```sh
  git lfs ls-files
```

### 5. Push the new LFS pointers to remote

```sh
  git lfs push origin my-branch
```

### 6. Push your branch

```sh
  git push -u origin my-branch
```

Enjoy!
